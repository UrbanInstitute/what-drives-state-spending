States with the highest spending on public colleges and universities tend to have lots of students (such as New Mexico, North Dakota, and Utah), high spending per student ([payroll + nonpayroll] * units) after accounting for tuition, fees, and other charges (such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Wisconsin), or both (such as California and Wyoming). Are states that spend more on higher education more productive (that is, do they confer more degrees per student)? The data suggest a weak relationship. Of course, institutions of higher education may have broader missions than simply granting degrees.

States with the most college-age residents (demographics) do not necessarily spend the most on public colleges and universities. For example, although both North Dakota and Rhode Island had a lot of 18- to 24-year-olds in 2012, North Dakota’s public spending after accounting for tuition, fees, and other charges was 5th in the nation, while Rhode Island’s ranked 48th. In North Dakota, however, only 61 percent of residents enrolled in college (compared with 66 percent nationally), and in Rhode Island half of all college students attended a private rather than public institution.

States generally do not provide grant aid to out-of-state students, and such students pay <a href = ="http://webapp.urban.org/higher-education/tuition.html">higher tuition and fees</a>, so they are less of a burden on state budgets. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont had some of the highest proportions of 18- to 24-year-olds in 2012, but they also had high proportions of students from out of state and relatively low higher-education spending per capita. They also had some of the lowest shares of students enrolled in public as opposed to private colleges and universities.

Some states that appear to have very high college enrollment as a share of the 18- to 24-year-old population (eligibility) may have more students coming from nontraditional age groups (younger than 17 or older than 25). Nationally, these groups constituted 43 percent of all public and private college and university enrollees in 2012. However, in Arizona and New Mexico, nontraditional students represented 49 and 55 percent of all students, respectively.

Alaska and Nevada had similarly low rates of college and university enrollment in 2012 (42 and 47 percent, respectively) but they tell very different stories. Alaska was one of the highest spenders per capita on higher education in that year, while Nevada was one of the lowest. Alaska was home to more 18- to 24-year-olds than Nevada (11 and 9 percent of the overall population, respectively). However, the driving factor here was staffing levels. In 2012, US public colleges and universities had roughly one employee for every 7 full-time equivalent students; Alaska, however, had one employee for every 5 such students, while Nevada had one employee for every such 11 students. Alaska had many more professors, lecturers, administrators, and other staff to pay in 2012.

A natural question for states with many public college and university students (take-up) is how many students are attending two- rather than four-year institutions. Two-year students tend to be less costly to the state, but they also pay <a href = "http://webapp.urban.org/higher-education/tuition.html">lower tuitions and fees</a>. In New Mexico and Wyoming, a majority of students are enrolled in two-year schools. However, this is not the case for other high take-up states such as Montana and Alaska, which had no community college system as of 2012.

Nonpayroll costs encompass any expense other than wages and salaries, including construction and other capital costs. On average, public higher-education institutions spent $104 per capita on capital projects in 2012. Some states, however, such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Wyoming, spent much more [add link to supplemental data table]. Spending rankings look very different if we exclude capital expenditures, which can fluctuate by year because of a few large projects, buildings, or facilities. For example, although Vermont is an average state in total higher education spending per capita, it jumps into the top 10 when we focus on current spending.

Georgia spends only an average amount even though it had the largest total correctional population per capita (take-up) in 2012, including twice as many people on probation as any other state. Georgia compensates for its high number of prisoners, probation population, and parolees by employing fewer staff (units) per probationer (prisoner or parolee) and spending less per employee on payroll costs. Combined with average nonpayroll costs, this leads to average overall spending despite heightened demands on the correctional system.

A major issue in corrections policy is crowding, or whether states are providing sufficient space and resources for their incarcerated populations. Although you might expect states to make compromises between spending on staff and spending on facilities, states with many employees per person under correctional supervision do not necessarily have more crowding. This suggests that states keep prisons open even after incarcerated populations fall (e.g., New York) or face crowding problems as well as staffing shortages for different reasons (e.g., California). Thus, the relationship between crowding and staffing ratios is unclear.

States that spend the most per capita on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance are not necessarily the ones with the largest shares of low-income families (demographics). This may be because the 1996 welfare reform law allowed states to spend on a variety of programs as long as spending satisfied one of four goals: (1) providing assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives; (2) promoting job preparation, work, and marriage among needy parents; (3) preventing and reducing the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and (4) encouraging the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. Nationally, the preponderance of TANF is spent on noncash assistance, although this proportion varies by state. Spending on noncash benefits is less targeted to the lowest-income recipients and less responsive to changes to family incomes in economic downturns.

States that spend the least per capita on TANF cash assistance (not including spending on child care through transfers to the Child Care Development Fund program) often have the most low-income families as a share of the overall population (demographics). Many, however, have also made policy decisions that restrict the number of families qualifying for assistance (eligibility). Further, low-spending states tend to spend less on cash assistance than on other benefits, such as work-related activities and programs geared toward preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies and promoting two-parent family formation and maintenance.

In those states, a higher percentage of low-income families are eligible for TANF cash assistance (eligibility) and more families have taken up benefits. Put another way, these states have chosen to provide less in benefits to more people, though they may also provide state-funded assistance outside of TANF.

Florida and Texas are both have shares of low-income families who can access cash assistance under TANF smaller than the national average. In those states, less than one-third of people in low-income families are eligible to receive cash assistance compared with 44 percent nationwide. This eligibility gap reflects policy decisions about who can receive benefits, for how long they can receive them, and what work activities are required of them. Since the 1996 welfare reform law that created TANF, states have had the flexibility to emphasize different goals and to vary their support for cash assistance rather than other types of support.

The <a href = "https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44528.pdf">Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF)</a> provides federal money to states to subsidize child care for low-income families. States supplement these dollars with their own and federal funds from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. This complex financing system means that state child care subsidy <a href = "http://www.urban.org/policy-centers/income-and-benefits-policy-center/projects/ccdf-policies-database">policies vary widely</a>.

However, participation in subsidized child care is often low in these states. That may be because states lack the resources to provide benefits to all families that qualify.

States with high participation rates in federal housing assistance programs (take-up) are a mix of high- and low-cost housing markets [link to FMRs supplemental table]. For example, Hawaii has a relatively high-cost housing market while South Dakota has a relatively low-cost one. Hawaii and South Dakota also had some of the longest wait times for federal public housing and renter assistance, suggesting demands that exceed support available [link to supplemental table].

The number of employees per recipient bore little relationship to wait times for public housing and renter assistance in 2012. This suggests that housing market characteristics, including costs [link to FMRs] and demands put upon housing programs, are more important than staffing levels in determining waiting times.

The data show that Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina, and Texas had the lowest staffing levels (units), and Illinois and North Carolina ranked first and ninth respectively in the proportion of residents who trusted government “not very much” or “none at all.” However, most residents in Texas (72 percent) and Indiana (68 percent) trusted government either “a fair amount” or “great deal,” placing both in the top 10 states for <a href = "">trust rankings</a>.

High payroll costs can reflect policy choices or background conditions, such as costs of living, that are beyond policymakers’ control. Isolating these factors for government employees is difficult, however, because the category encompasses so many different fields and types of workers.

Spending on natural resources includes spending on water and mineral resources management, agriculture development, conservation, and the regulation of industries that develop or use natural resources. The 10 states with the highest spending all have major industries that rely on natural resources, such as mining or oil and gas extraction. High spending in those 10 states may be because of such industries, or it may simply reflect state natural resource endowments (which require higher spending).

Among the five states that spend the most on natural resources, Alaska is the only one with below-average nonpayroll spending. That may be because the federal government owns around 61 percent of Alaska as federal lands, placing a lesser burden on the state for infrastructure spending and other nonpayroll spending. Indeed, in 2012, only 6 percent of Alaska’s natural resources spending went to capital outlays, such as irrigation, drainage, and flood control or dam and reservoir safety projects.

Tennessee collected $201 per capita but spent just $154, leading to negative net spending in that year.

State and local governments often charge a fee for utility services, such as solid waste management. Some states have negative net spending per capita, which means that they make more in fees than they spend on garbage pickup, street cleaning, and solid waste management. Spending per capita figures are therefore a function of three elements: actual expenditures, population, and charges. States can rank high if they spend a lot, have low charges, or have a relatively low population for their spending level. Conversely, states can rank low if they spend a lot but have high charges or if they spend less per capita.

States can’t control the share of children in the state or how many children enroll in public school, but these factors can affect the cost of education. When a state with a lot of children and high public school take-up raises salaries, for example, they are raising salaries for more teachers and other school employees and therefore end up spending more per capita. That is why many states with many public-school students have lower staffing ratios or lower salaries (payroll) and other costs (nonpayroll) per employee, keeping spending per capita low. For a state to rank high on every measure, it must spend more per capita, as in the case of Alaska.

New York and Florida show how demographics are not destiny for school budgets. Both states have relatively few school-age kids (demographics) and low public-school enrollments (take-up). However, New York had the fourth highest K–12 spending per capita in 2012 while Florida ranked 50th. New York employed more teachers and other personnel while also paying its employees more, although much of this difference is explained by costs of living or labor market conditions. Florida, by contrast, had relatively few public-school employees and paid them less than what labor market conditions would suggest.

In every state, all kids are eligible for public school, although some may drop out or graduate early for various reasons. Vermont had the lowest rates of enrollment in any school (public or private) in 2012; DC had the highest. Those differences may stem from compulsory education laws: DC in 2012 required kids to be in school from ages 5 to 18 while Vermont was one of several states that required kids to attend school only from ages 6 to 16.

Western states often have the highest public-school take-up rates. West Virginia and Maine are exceptions, however, as Eastern states with some of the lowest private school enrollment rates in the country. Those two states also had moderate spending on K–12 education in 2012 despite having few kids per capita, suggesting that factors other than demographics and take up, such as the number of teachers and other public school employees, play a more important role.

Many states with high private school enrollments (low take-up rates) nevertheless spend a lot on public schools. Some of these states (such as Nebraska and New York) have a lot of public-school teachers and other personnel (units), which drives up spending. Others have moderate staffing ratios but spend a lot per employee (such as Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).

States with the lowest staffing ratios (units) are among the highest spenders on K–12 education. This is because education is labor intensive and labor is expensive, especially in states such as New Jersey and New York. Some (though not all) of this difference is explained by costs of living or labor market conditions.

States with high payroll costs are often among those that spend the most. High payroll costs can reflect policy choices or economic factors, including costs of living, beyond policymakers’ control. If living costs are high, we would expect to see all public and private employers paying more to attract and retain workers. But several states pay salaries and wages in K–12 education higher than what we would expect based on this overall location premium or cost-of-living adjustment.

Spending on fire protection in 2012 ranged from $34 per capita in Delaware to $333 per capita in DC. Rhode Island was not far behind DC, spending $274 per capita. Other high spenders included densely populated states (such as California, Florida, Illinois, and New York) as well as states with large rural or undeveloped areas (such as Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington). One reason that these very different groups of states occupy the top of the spending rankings may be that fire protection is an exclusively local function in our framework. Therefore, states that have more cities per capita will have higher fire protection expenditures per capita. States with fewer cities that are farther apart from one another may also have higher expenditures because of fewer opportunities to share services and costs.

States with high payroll costs are often expensive places to live. But in some states with the highest local fire-protection payroll expenses (especially California and Nevada), local governments paid their employees more than this location premium would suggest. Other states at the low end of payroll costs per employee actually paid less than what other employers in the state paid for comparable workers. Higher salaries may reflect a higher level of firefighter quality or a level of education beyond what we assumed (some college) in our comparisons.

Capital spending is a small fraction of local fire protection expenditures. Only six percent of all fire spending went toward capital projects in 2012. North Dakota had the highest capital spending as a share of total fire protection expenditure in 2012 (28 percent). This is perhaps why the state’s nonpayroll costs were among the highest in the nation. However, the state was near the bottom in capital spending per capita.

States with the highest police expenditures per capita generally do not have the highest crime rates (take-up). DC, an outlier because it resembles a city more than a state, had the highest crime rate, and it spent the most on police protection in 2012. But New York, with the second-highest police expenditures per capita, had a crime rate lower than all states except Idaho and North Dakota.

Police protection is a labor-intensive public service, so it is unsurprising that payroll spending is a major driver of spending, constituting nearly two-thirds of US police expenditures in 2012. Some high-spending states (such as California, New Jersey, and New York) had very high payroll expenditures per employee in 2012; low-spending states had very low payroll per employee. Nonpayroll spending also contributes to state spending differences, but there are notable exceptions, such as New York and New Jersey, where nonpayroll spending was low despite high spending per capita.

It is tempting to look at the inverse relationship between crime rates (take-up) and staffing levels (units) in some states and infer that hiring more police officers and other employees reduces crime. Because we calculated staffing levels by considering the number of employees per crime, however, this is a tricky comparison to make. Looking at police employment and crimes both per capita, there is not a strong relationship between the number of police employees and crime rates. Moreover, we cannot say from our data whether staffing levels affect crime or vice versa.

Police employees include sworn officers who have the power to make arrests and nonsworn employees who do not have such power. In the United States, 76 percent of police employees are sworn officers. DC has the highest sworn-officer share, at 87 percent, and Alaska has the lowest at 62 percent. Sworn officers also earn higher wages and salaries than nonsworn employees (nearly double nationally and even more in some jurisdictions). The share of sworn offers does not vary much by state, however, and it is therefore unlikely that this factor exerts a major effect on spending differences.

The 10 states that spent the most in police payroll per employee were often among the top spenders overall. Washington is a notable exception. Despite high payroll costs, it spent among the least in 2012. Washington had the lowest number of employees per crime in that year and fairly low nonpayroll spending. Given that New Jersey and New York had even lower nonpayroll spending, however, Washington’s low total spending was likely more driven by staffing levels.

Payroll rankings seem to be driven both by labor market conditions and policy decisions. States with the highest payroll expenditures per employee were often expensive places to live.  But some high-spending states paid their police employees even more than this location premium.  In California, for example, we would expect workers with some college to earn about 20 percent more than in the United States as a whole. Yet state and local governments paid nearly 40 percent more to police employees. This may reflect other, unmeasured worker attributes that contribute to quality or a policy decision to pay these employees more. (For comparisons using other education reference groups, see our data appendix.)

Alaska spent significantly more on nonpayroll expenses per employee than any other state in 2012. Alaska also spent more on capital projects, such as police stations, in that year (4.7 percent of total spending versus 3.8 percent for the United States as a whole). But other states (such as Oklahoma, Missouri, New York, and Virginia) also spent more than average on capital projects and still were not among those with the highest nonpayroll spending. One possible explanation for Alaska’s high nonpayroll spending (and that of other sparsely populated or rural states) is that although the state serves a relatively small population, providing public safety in spread out, sparsely populated places is expensive.

Two types of states spend a lot per capita on highways, roads, and bridges. The first group includes states with small populations spread over large distances (such as Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming). Roads are used relatively lightly (units), so they don’t require extensive maintenance and repairs, but lane miles are still high, which adds to the overall highways tab. The second group includes states such as Maryland and DC, where lane miles are lower but traffic volume is greater, which contributes to higher costs per road mile (payroll and nonpayroll).

Maryland, Utah, and DC, for example, are all among the top spenders overall, but they drop to middle of the pack when we consider current expenditures alone (excluding capital investments) [add link to supplementary table]. Capital spending can also vary by year because of a few large projects, so looking at trends over time is important [add link to downloadable time series data].

In many states with few vehicle miles traveled, people use relatively few miles of roadway intensively (units). This is not the case in Alaska, but high spending per lane mile in 2012 may have been caused by extreme weather conditions or simply access to additional revenue from oil-related sources.

States with the highest payroll expenditures per highway mile are often expensive places to live. All public and private employers in these states must pay higher wages and salaries to attract workers of a given education level. When we compare actual highway payroll expenses per employee to what we would expect based on averages for all workers with some college education (comparisons for other educational categories are available here [link]), high payroll spending is largely explained by labor market conditions in states such as New Jersey and New York, but not California.

States with the highest transit spending per capita tend to be large and densely populated [link to supplemental population table]. Residents take many trips on buses, subways, street cars, commuter railroads, and other mass transit. However, the average length of each trip (take-up) is generally not long. In many of these states (especially Hawaii, New York, Massachusetts, and DC), the ratio of transit system miles to miles people ride (units) is low, suggesting that people use the whole system intensively rather than only a few routes. Payroll and nonpayroll costs per transit way mile are often high, perhaps reflecting this heavy use. Transit systems in high-spending states also collect the most in fares.
